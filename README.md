# Small self-study project for webdev class

## Languages:
HTML, CSS

## Description:
A design for the fictional futuristic sci-fi company Axiom Dynamics centered around the theme of gold and black. Heavily inspired by the game Deus Ex: Human Revolution. I've wanted to make a design around GOLD for a long time and I think this turned out great.
